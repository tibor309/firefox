# ðŸ¦Š Firefox ESR
This is the [esr][esr_build][^1] version of the firefox browser, updated every every month.

> [!NOTE]
> Automatic builds has been paused for this version, due to lack of interest. If you need an updated version, you'll need to rebuild the image yourself!

## Setup
To use this version, change the docker image tag to `esr`. You can read more about setup options on the [main page][main].

[^1]: ESR releases are maintained for more than a year, with point releases that coincide with regular Firefox releases. These point releases contain security upgrades. [Learn more][esr_support]
